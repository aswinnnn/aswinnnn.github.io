Life flows like a lotus on a river, about to plunge into thesea and drown at the so-called end of the journey. It's almost more than a year after my first blog and I have learnt a lot of things I couldn't list down in a blog post. I'm kidding, I can:<ol><li>never judge yourself based on how you judge others, sometimes you're a prick to others and you end up being one to yourself.</li><br><li>Being afraid of people, places and life can only be cured by those things. It sounds ignorant but let me explain:<br>You'd don't really get to decide where you're born and who you get to be around when you first grow up, but the second time you grow up? You get to pick the kind of people you want. It's hard, you make insanely bad choices at first, but at last with a lot of self reflection and crying and thinking you get to really look at what and where makes you happy. I like being around my friends and the knowledge of everything around me makes me happy. What happens when the people around you find you wrong? Then you're around the wrong people. It requires a lot of attention and calm but you can move out of your only safe place to unknown places (with a hard hat) and find a safe place that's actually safe.<br>Back before my first blog, I was at a grayscale school in a room full of colorful people, which meant you had to be colorful as well. I hated it but it didn't bother me that much, I just did not follow them. Then I get thrown into a new school full of dumb people smart people boring people and most of all, people that were different from each other. I guess there were enough kids that I ended up finding people I could connect with without having to be colorful, inside or outside. Though by the end, I mean right now, My mind and my heart are both more vibrant than any extroverted socialite with a million memories that look like daydreams could have. It's like before there was a brass scale and I was at one end and the other was "normal" kids. Now at one end there's absolute shit, and the other end is absolute gold. Both are part of my experience of this unknown place. I faced so many interesting social situations from getting in a fight to having the best days of my life yet with people that I truly care for.<br>My life is not black and white anymore, and that was my first fear. Now that I finally have color, when will I take the paint brush?</li></ol><br>Tune in next whenever for some more emotional monologues that feature overused metaphors. I know, But I haven't written anything for almost an year and I couldn't help myself. Promise the next one's gonna be more insightful and less sentimental.</article><footer><p>&copy; <a href="/">Aswin.</a></p></footer></body><script>const modeSwitch = document.getElementById('mode-switch'); const labelSwitch = document.getElementById('label-switch'); function toggleDarkMode() { const darkMode = modeSwitch.checked; document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', darkMode ?
