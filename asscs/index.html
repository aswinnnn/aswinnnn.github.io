          <i>
          Ages ago, aswin had implanted the idea of a survival guide for the socially curious. It ended in a scattered abandoned manner, but still resulting in something unknowingly awesome at the time for a high schooler reflecting on sociality. The saga continues to his first day of college...

          I remember creating ASGSC for a number of reasons:
        </p>
        <ul class="article-list">
          <li>wanting to reflect on how i connect with the outside world</li>
          <li>my experience as a human, growing</li>
          <li>being anxious as fuck. like lots of anxiety.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-content">
          i would never admit to starting this blog because of anxiety back in 2022 of July, but 2024? a lot of things have changed (including my design skills lol).
          I shall describe mundane but scary social situations in such a horrific manner that kafka would turn into a butterfly. I am the creator of my reality. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="article-content">
          if my goal was to tackle fear i would have done that already, this blog series aims to poke at something different, the human experience of overthinking too much and being afraid but still wanting to experience humanity with all of my senses, to the fullest. This sounds like the perfect introduction to a mindfullness meditation class.

          As i sit here, trying to type something witty hurrily so i can eat and spend the rest of my mobile data on things that will distract me from the fact that its my first day of college tomorrow, i begin to understand that i have absolutely nothing to write. I'm empty because I've had no experiences yet. i wanna find people and talk to them and i'll get back to you and bitch and moan about them tomorrow, c'ya till then.
