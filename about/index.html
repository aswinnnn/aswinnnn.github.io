          This website offers my statements
          towards the absurd. As you dig deeper
          you'll find that I offer almost nothing
          here and that its a dumpster fire of sorts.
          Bear with me as I traverse the world
          of internet blogging and reporting
          by stealing themes while being original
          and compact and absolutely not slow
          and copied at all.
