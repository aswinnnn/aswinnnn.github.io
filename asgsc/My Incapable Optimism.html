      <div class="blog-text"> What's the deal with people talking? It's so easy to reciprocate but also hard to understand. The number of times I say the same thing someone's told me back to them with slight variations are comedically high. Don't look at me like that, I don't hate people. I think people are lovely as they come. Some come rotten.<br><br>You'd expect being questionably autistic would get someone in trouble for saying things they're not supposed to but surprisingly I've seen more socially armored people do it. Maybe that previous sentence contains exactly why they do it. They're armored and no one can hurt them. It hurts when someone points out something you don't want to or you're having a perfect day and someone's comment ruins it for you, but I think what we should learn from those experiences is that you wish they'll fall in a gutter and pray that no one tells you that you're hairlines receded again. Sociality is part the agony it throws at you and part the never-ending  journey of hoping you find someone who you genuinely, deeply care about and they do back. Romantic or not. </div>
