      <div class="blog-text"> The first week feels like an illusion inside an illusion. You talk to people, you stand around people and you orbit people. When I'm not talking to my newly-made friends there's usually one guy leading a conversation and 3 guys chiming in on it and 4 guys listening in on it without saying anything with their arms folded, moving around. It's weird how no one notices it. I bet they do but they don't think about it. it's weird that i think about it. <br><br>Anyway, illusions are easy to break. The fact that your newly-made friend might be transferring to another school or that people you idealize might not be too fond of you. In the end, missing my bus and having to catch 2 other buses  ended up useful because it gave me time to think about what I learned this week. I got absolutely nothing until i jumped from the bus, started walking home in the rain. I figured it was a nice time to have an epiphany, like in those movies. I realized halfway through rain drops falling from my hair that i should stop looking for one and just soak in the feelings. I was feeling warm and I was glad this unfortunate incident of having to change schools lead me to discover part of myself.  I faced all (most) of my anxiety, broke on through to the other side and was at a place, at a moment, at a present. I realized i must have balls of steel to do all of that but I had something much better at the end of day, awesomeness. </div>
