      <div class="blog-text"> I have a black shirt that somehow lacks a collar, dark jeans and...myself. Somehow strangers were looking at me that day even after I made sure I don't have awful hair or if my foreheads too big. You think you're hungry for attention and when you do get it you're not sure if you really needed it in the first place. I blame the black shirt for what happened the day which I'll describe.<br><br>After the teacher looked at every boy in the class like a plane in battlefield looking for the perfect place to drop the bomb, she lands on me. I'm the class leader. I'm not the first choice, fyi it was some guy then another guy then me. I'm  not sure how I stuck around.<br><br>Here's why being a class leader sucks:<br>&#x2c5d; you're expected to be a narc.<br> &#x2c5d; you have to do all the scut work related to your class for the teachers, which I don't mind but hey, its scut work.<br>&#x2c5d; you're expected to be a role model. Imagine giving that social responsibility to a guy who writes blogs about sociality. Nice.<br>&#x2c5d; you're expected to be a narc. Completely tanks my social points at a new school.<br><br>Sometimes attention's all you need and sometimes its not. Be careful what you wish for, folks.  That's all for today. </div>
