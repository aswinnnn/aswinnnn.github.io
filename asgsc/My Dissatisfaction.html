      <div class="blog-text"> My realization was a good note to leave my blog on and never write again till yet another realization led me to believe it was only half the battle.<br>I've only been comfortable enough with the people around me and the places around me but I haven't been comfortable in my own mind yet. I'd blame this on my social anxiety but you know what? I blame it on my entire upbringing. <br>While being "social" I still have to suffer through the ideas of envy, jealousy, greed and other biblical offenses but practical daily thoughts you'd have to go through at school. It's okay that I go through this and Its more than okay that I am realizing it and that I want to change how I behave and be more comfortable in my own mind.<br>I love everyone around me but I cannot have everyone around me. <br>Is what I have better than what I lack? - the question itself doesn't make much sense but the more and more I look into it the more profound effect it has on me.<br>Its not all "me vs me" either, I know a few pretty good people now and I got to know like one of the coolest people I'd ever meet in this school today. Never give up hope, people. That's all for today. </div>
