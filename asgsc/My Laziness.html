      <div class="blog-text"> I haven't pretty much wrote anything for the past couple of days due to either me being lazy or me not being able to get social anecdotes and  meta criticism due to being given holidays for the heavy rain, I cannot decide on an excuse.<br>Anyways, hobbies are so cool. Interests too. I wish more people related to me using my interests but its unfortunate I don't fit in the majority of popular topics around here. I mean, who wants to talk about cricket, football, and senseless banter all day? I'd appreciate if the banters were at least intellectually or just absurdly interesting.<br>The fun parts of my daily life at a school is when I stand around my friends with them making fun of each other and me and vice versa. I'm glad Its an actual normal social situation that all friend-groups I've been on participate in because without  it I'd basically start manipulating people into liking my niche interests and turning them into mini-mes (Also, an Austin Powers reference for all you lovely folks who get it). </div>
