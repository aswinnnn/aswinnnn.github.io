      <div class="blog-text"> Taking a day off was fun. But weekends are not. I do some hackthebox, look at different things on the internet and almost never end up rewatching The Breakfast Club. I used to think I end up unsatisfied at the end of the day because of my how much there is in my todo list but really I think it's because I have no real passion to do those things. It's easy to find passion once you know you're doing it to fullfil your own whatever happy fantasy you have. Nothing social today. Aswin out. </div>
