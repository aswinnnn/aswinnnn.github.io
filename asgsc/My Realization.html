        I know I said about social attractiveness yesterday but lets scratch that. I just found out why its so stupid. I was sitting around in the last period of my class when suddenly, as narcissistic it is that I have a friend (not really close but is someone to talk to) in every bench students sit in. There's 8 rows and 4 students in a bench. I'm pretty proud I got there in just 2 weeks.<br><br>The whole idea that you have to be socially interesting to make friends is wrong.<br>The whole idea that you need to have things in common to be friends is wrong, but not completely.<br>The whole idea you need to be someone else to make friends is wrong. Though hiding parts of yourself is okay....depends on the part.<br><br>I can't believe it would be so early but I'll have to stop posting here one day because I promised I would journal my journey to be fit in a functional social group till I was comfortable. I'm not that comfortable yet but each day it  becomes easier and that indicates:<br><i>+ time and trying lets you be you without awkward feelings in a social situation<br>+ listening to people and the 'little things' will help you a lot. Ask for favors and do favors.<br>+ keep an open mind and always think there's something about someone that you don't know yet.<br>+ the last and the most important:<br>+ + get out of your head and do what's in-front of you. It sounds like a made up non-autistic-friendly sentence but doing whatever task that has been given to you in an appropriate social situation always reaps benefits no matter the outcome. </i><br><br><br>I hated people and socializing till I joined this school. My mindset about people were wrong and toxic (maybe my previous school's social eco-system was a bit toxic too...just maybe)<br>but in the end exposing yourself to the harmful radiations of sociality rips off the old, uptight and anxious skin revealing your comfortable, friendly and human side no matter who, what or how you are. <br>Thanks for the amazing opportunity to write this. I love you all, social enthusiasts.
