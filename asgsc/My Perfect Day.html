      <div class="blog-text"> I woke up today with the worst outlook of the world possible. My newly-made best friend called me up a few hours ago to tell me he finally got in and will never return to my school again. I congratulated him and concluded that god hates me and teases me with normal social lives every now and then only to take them away the very next second.<br><br>I had a good day because I didn't react to anything in a way I didn't want to. It was just as eye opening  as any other day but today I didn't give a shit about whatever things people pointed out to me, I had fun with a few lots of people and it was awesome. Might have something to do with the class clowns not being there? (Probably....) But I betcha I could do it again I had the least expectations for the day.<br>That's right people, I figured out the most effective social strategy that was mentioned in Buddhism a lot.<br><br><i> The act of not having any expectations forces you to look at every positive thing as positive. That's good. That's enough to get you through a day of losing a friend and a day of...life.</i> </div>
