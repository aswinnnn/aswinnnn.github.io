      <div class="blog-text"> Happy Independence Day! Talking about independence reminds me that a lot of people are dependent on a lot of people. homes to workers, kids to parents and me to how socially attractive I am. I'll be making a whole post about what social attraction is tomorrow.<br><br>I received an award for academic excellence from my neighborhood. There were like 11 people receiving awards and I was one of them. The anxiety of the situation dissolves when you find out that you aren't really talkative to much of the neighborhood kids. <b> It's okay. You don't have to talk and be friends with everyone to be in the same space as them. </b><br><br>Something that came into my head when I was awkwardly standing around people my age talking to each other is that <i> the brain isn't designed to keep you happy, It's designed to keep you alive. </i><br><b>It's okay you're not doing happy things like talking, gossiping and trying to be friends with everyone around you sometimes. You will be happy in time. You will be happy in your own comfortable way in your own comfortable time.</b><br>I'm just so positive today, aren't I? See you tomorrow, survival enthusiasts. </div>
