          It is a period of the absurd.
          Rebel minds, such as aswin
          form websites with plagiarised themes
          to mark their place in the chaos,
          (and hopefully understand the world,
          as you know it).

          This website offers my statements
          towards the absurd. As you dig deeper
          you'll find that I offer almost nothing
          here and that its a dumpster fire of sorts.
          Bear with me as I traverse the world
          of internet blogging and reporting
          by stealing themes while being original 
          and compact and absolutely not slow 
          and copied at all.

          Pursued by the Empire's
          sinister agents, Princess
          Leia races home aboard her
          starship, custodian of the
          stolen plan that can save
          her people and restore
          freedom to the galaxy....
